      <description>Effective communication requires getting definitions right. Very often the same word can have different meanings and lead to confusion. Good example of that would be term Consistency. In this article we will take a look at consistency in CAP and ACID and differences between them.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with defining CAP and ACID.&#xA;CAP theorem is formulated by computer scientist Eric Brewer in 2000, and states that a distributed data store cannot simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:</description>

      <description>Sander Mak&amp;rsquo;s talk &amp;ldquo;The Art of Software development&amp;rdquo; at JFall conference and discussions with my colleagues left me puzzled somehow. Is software development more art than engineering? What is it that I am doing anyway?&#xA;Around that time I read an article about Jens Haaning, a Danish conceptual artist who was commissioned by museum to recreate two earlier works that used scores of banknotes to represent average incomes. When museum stuff received the work they discovered two empty frames with the title “Take the Money and Run”.</description>

      <description>Reduction is a basic technique in algorithm design.&#xA;A problem A reduces to problem B if we can use an algorithm that solves B to develop an algorithm that solves A.&#xA;This concept should be pretty familiar in software development. For example, when you use method evaluate() of Apache Commons library to solve a problem, your problem is reduced to the one solved by library method.&#xA;Simple example of reduction would be finding a median in a collection.</description>

      <description>Looking through Kotlin documentation made me think about mistakes.&#xA;To be more precise, mentioning development of Null reference by Tony Hoare and how that was a mistake. Later I found the same reference in an article about error handling. When I googled it, there were many more places that talked about so-called &amp;ldquo;billion-dollar mistake&amp;rdquo;: articles, pictures of the mountains with a quote (as if it is supposed to be an inspiration), even a conference talk.</description>

      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://savchenko.tech/posts/liskov/</guid>
      <description>Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is one of the five SOLID principles. It is based on the concept of &amp;ldquo;substitutability&amp;rdquo;. Principle allows using code to be written in terms of the supertype specification, yet work correctly when using objects of the subtype.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What is wanted here is something like the following substitution property: If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T.</description>

      <description>For me, as a software engineer with experience in Java, Kotlin was definitely the language of interest. It is also JVM language, but promised to be improved, concise, readable and beautiful.&#xA;So, what are the advantages of Kotlin?&#xA;Null safety - null references are detected at compile time.&#xA;Fluency - fluent code is readable and easier (and cheaper) to maintain.&#xA;Coroutines - a great way to implement non-blocking calls and gracefully handle exceptions.</description>

      <description>A Linked List is fundamental and incredibly useful. It enables implementation of bags, queues and stacks.&#xA;It is a recursive data structure. In the core of Linked List is Node that contains of generic item and reference to the next node.&#xA;Node abstraction would be a nested class in Linked List and would look like this:&#xA;private static class Node&amp;lt;E&amp;gt; { E value; Node&amp;lt;E&amp;gt; next; public Node(E value) { this.value = value; } } Insertion an element to the beginning of the Linked List.</description>

      <description>Prim&amp;rsquo;s algorithm is a greedy algorithm for computing Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).&#xA;Greedy algorithms is a technique used in designing and analyzing efficient algorithms. They typically apply to optimization problems in which you make a set of choices in order to arrive at an optimal solution. A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment. It makes a locally optimal choice in hope that this choice leads to globally optimal solution.</description>

      <description>In this article we will be looking at Single-source shortest path problem. The classical method for solving it is Breadth First Search (BFS). In BFS we want to explore the vertices in order of their distance from the source. It could be achieved with queue and filling in last edge on the shortest path for every vertex.&#xA;Unit test should check if the shortest path is returned, when there is longer path in the graph.</description>

      <description>Graph algorithms solve many problems in computer science and are fundamental to the field. Depth First Search (DFS) is one of them.&#xA;Representation of a graph Before we dive into DFS we need to understand Graph structure and terminology.&#xA;Graph is a set of vertices and a collection of edges that each connect a pair of vertices.&#xA;Examples of a Graph would be:&#xA;in finance : Currency is a vertex, transaction is an edge in transportation : Street intersection is a vertex, route is an edge Vertex 1 is connected to Vertex 2 when there is an edge between them.</description>

      <description>Dictionary operations (INSERT, SEARCH and DELETE) are required by many applications. One very effective data structures for implementing dictionaries is hash table. The average time to search for an element in hash table is O(1).&#xA;Hash table ia unordered symbol table where key is interpreted as an array index and value associated with key &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo; is stored in array entry &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;Two main parts in hash algorithm are hash function and collision resolution method.</description>

      <description>To implement delete() method we need to take care about helper methods first. First we will take a look at deleteMin().&#xA;DELETE MIN Test cases for deleteMin() should check that:&#xA;minimal element is not present tree is balanced, which means: there is no more than 1 left RED links in the row there is no right RED link root should be always BLACK @Test void shouldDeleteMinElement() { RedBlackBinarySearchTree&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt; brBinarySearchTree = createRedBlackBST(); brBinarySearchTree.</description>

      <description>Red-Black Tree is a Binary Search Tree with one extra bit of storage per node - color, which can be either RED or BLACK. We need it to keep BST &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo;, that means basic dynamic set operations will be fast (guaranteed time O(lg n) ).&#xA;Red-black tree has next properties:&#xA;Every node is RED or BLACK The root id always BlACK Every null leaf is black If a node is RED, then both children are BLACK For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of BLACK nodes.</description>

      <description>Rust has been getting 1st place in Stack Overflow’s annual developer survey “most loved programming language” since 2016. Google develops parts of Android with Rust. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has used Rust since 2017 for its serverless computing offerings, AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate. Microsoft writes components of its Azure platform including a security daemon for its Internet of Things (IoT) service.&#xA;Big addition to this popularity wave was Linus Torvald&amp;rsquo;s announcement on Open Source Summit that Rust can be added to the Linux kernel in the next major release.</description>

      <description>Development of computational infrastructure would not become available without effective searching algorithms. One type of such algorithms is symbol tables. Term symbol table is used to describe a mechanism where we can save information (value) and later retrieve it by specified key. Symbol tables sometimes also referred as dictionaries.&#xA;There are three main classic data structures that can support efficient symbol-table implementations: binary search trees, red -black trees and hash tables.</description>

      <description>Since Alan Turing time we came from running one program at a time on bare metal to running millions of java virtual threads. Which is absolutely impressive.&#xA;Why? Why should we care about threads at all? The answer is - performance. Applying concurrency can improve performance in a few ways:&#xA;reducing latency (process one task faster) hiding latency (process another task while waiting) increasing throughput (process more tasks). Current java concurrency implementation is based on the rule that one Java thread equals exactly one OS thread (one-to-one mapping).</description>

      <description>Why do we care about programming paradigms?&#xA;The answer is they help us to align with architectural concerns like boundaries, location and accessing data and algorithm foundation in the modules.&#xA;Programming paradigms are ways of programming that are reflected in language features. They tell us which structures to use and when to use them.&#xA;There are 3 such main paradigms:&#xA;structured programming&#xA;object-orient programming&#xA;functional programming.&#xA;Most languages are multi-paradigm but levels of restrictions/enforcing can be different.</description>

      <description>When building software systems we need to avoid a mess at any cost. The more messy software is, the more expensive is to change and maintain it.&#xA;Main design smells that lead to costs increase are:&#xA;rigidity - when tight coupling leads to major rebuild and makes it harder to make changes fragility - when inappropriate and insufficient isolation of software parts leads to one change cause other unrelated modules crash or misbehave immobility - when software structures can not be reused To avoid these design smells and make our software easy to change, understand and reuse we need a guide how to combine functions, data structures and classes - design principles.</description>

      <description>Effective public speaking is a crucial to your personal, professional and social success. At the same time many developers luck the confidence to communicate clearly, which leads to missing out on career opportunities.&#xA;The biggest threat to our confidence is anxiety, in other words - being nervous. Anxiety - is a signal that we are doing something important. So you can not get rid of it completely. But we do not want anxiety to prevent us from being ourselves and let our skills shine.</description>

      <description>Communication protocols play essential role in every modern software system. With increasing popularity of Microservice architecture inter-process communication techniques become even more important.&#xA;The most common way to build request-response style communication is RESTful services. However, REST can be inefficient and error-prone to use in microservices. We would need something more scalable, loosely coupled and efficient. That is where gRPC will shine.&#xA;gRPC (the “g” stands for something different in every gRPC release) is an inter-process communication technology that allows you to connect, invoke, operate, and debug distributed heterogeneous applications as easily as making a local function call.</description>
